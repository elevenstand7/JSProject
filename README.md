## Background

"Whack-a-Mole" is a popular arcade game that was invented in the early 1970s. It is very simple, but highly entertaining, and as a result, it has been loved by people of all ages for decades. The game follows these rules:

- In the game, you'll find a game surface that resembles a farm, complete with multiple holes. Moles will unpredictably emerge from these holes.

- Players have control over a mallet, and their objective is to strike the moles as they pop up, earning points for each successful hit.

- The player's goal is to attain a higher score within a designated time frame.

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

*   The Canvas API to render the game
*   DOM Manipulation to handle events, update scores, and manage game states
*   npm to manage project dependencies
*   Webpack to bundle the source JavaScript code
*   Animation may be apply to the animation of the game
*   Audio API may be apply to the background music(bonus)

## Implementation Timeline

*   **Thursday:** Set up the project, including getting webpack up and running. Let the canvas display on the screen, and create the HTML structure for the game, including the game board and buttons. Begin styling with basic CSS to make the game visually presentable.

*   **Friday & Weekend:** Implement the game logic, ensure that I can create moles that pop up randomly, add event listeners for user interactions, create a simple scoring system and a countdown timer for the game.,

*   **Monday:** Debug and test the game's core functionality. Enhance the game's styling with CSS to make it visually appealing.

*   **Tuesday:** If my previous feature functions well, add the basic sound effects (e.g., background music and mole popping sound).

*   **Wednesday Morning:** Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.

## Bonus features
*   Add difficulty level selection(In hard mode, there will be bombs that reduce the scores.)
*   Add audio feature
